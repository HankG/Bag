A Bag is a collection of values in text-based key/value pairs or arrays. Typing is
performed lazily on extraction, and presumes the user knows what they are expecting to get.
These classes are primarily intended for messaging, events, and other applications that
require complex values to be shared in a text-based data interchange format. Bag is loosely
based on a combination of XML in use, and the JSONObject from the website
(http://www.json.org).
