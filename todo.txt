- Following release instructions at http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html
    * mvn release:clean release:prepare && mvn release:perform

- some thinking about xml and arrays...
- add xml deserialization
- document the Bag type - along with the hierarchical indexing support
- add a Database type, based on a bagarray, complete with sort, search, filter, etc.
- consider BagObject.objectify invoking the Serializer when it encounters an unsupported type, or
  throw an exception in that case rather than fail silently - with instructions to tell the user
  they should use the Serializer if this is what they intended (maybe add 'addAsType' method?)
