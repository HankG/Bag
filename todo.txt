- Following release instructions at http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html
    * mvn release:clean release:prepare && mvn release:perform

- add xml serialization
- rethink "toString", etc. as "toJSON"?
- consider eliminating object creation in binary search
- change BagObject so that "add" implicitly changes the underlying type to an array if it's not
  already an array, and stores the original value in the new array
