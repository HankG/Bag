- Following release instructions at http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html
    * mvn release:clean release:prepare release:perform

- add a Database type, based on a bagarray, complete with sort, search, filter, etc. (or just do
  that on BagArray?)
- in BagArray, allow string based indexing for a 'put' operation
- rename 'getObject' to 'get'?
- 'putType' and 'getType' methods that invoke the Serializer?
- should the serializer be automatically invoked when objectify fails with an unknown type? I think
  not, because the user will otherwise have to know to extract via the serializer
- XML...
- iterators?
